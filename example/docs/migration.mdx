# Migration

## Breaking changes

There are plenty of breaking changes between `2.x.x` and `3.x.x`, so read this document carefully before upgrade the library version.

### Importing Styles

The styles now should be imported explicitly:

```tsx
import 'react-indiana-drag-scroll/dist/style.css'
```

The styles is used to stylize `ScrollContainer`, they hides the scrollbars and sets the basic styles to the container:
 ```css
.indiana-scroll-container {
	overflow: auto;
	cursor: grab;
}

.indiana-scroll-container--hide-scrollbars {
	overflow: -moz-scrollbars-none;
	-ms-overflow-style: none;
	scrollbar-width: none;
}

.indiana-scroll-container--hide-scrollbars::-webkit-scrollbar {
	display: none !important;
	height: 0 !important;
	width: 0 !important;
	background: transparent !important;
	-webkit-appearance: none !important;
}
 ```

### Moved props

The props `activationDistance`, `ignoreElements`, `buttons` are passed as the fields of configuration object in the `mouseScroll` prop
to emphasize that they affects only scroll by mouse drag.

### Removed props

#### `horizontal`

The horizontal scroll is available until there is the vertical scroll. This prop added additional logic that contradicts to the library philosophy.

If you need to disable horizontal scroll use the styles:
```css
overflow-x: hidden;
```

#### `vertical`

The vertical scroll is available until there is the vertical scroll. This prop added additional logic that contradicts to the library philosophy.

If you need to disable vertical scroll use the styles:
```css
overflow-y: hidden;
```

#### `draggingClassName`

This prop is redundant. The user can add the additional class name by using the combination of `onStartScroll` and `onEndScroll`.

#### `innerRef`

This prop is redundant. Use `ref` instead.

#### `onClick`

This prop is redundant. You can create the wrapper for your content and `onClick` callback to it.

#### `nativeMobileScroll`

This props was removed because it contradicts the philosophy of the library. The mobile devices should always use
the native scroll. It's impossible to make the scroll better than browsers do.

### Removed static functions

#### `getElement`

This function is redundant. You can get direct access to the scroll container via `ref`.
